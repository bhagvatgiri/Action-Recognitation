# Action-Recognitation
1.1.	Project Summary and Introduction

Action Recognition is the task of identifying human actions or gestures made by humans.
A Human Recognition System (HAR) is capable of identifying human actions or gestures from a digital image or from video frame of short length. There are multiple methods in which action recognition work, but in general, they work by classifying human actions from actions performed by humans within a database. Action Recognition is one of the most challenging topics in computer vision today. 

This type of system has many applications in current world some of them are as follows: HAR system can be used in smart assisted home living in which humans actions are captured on regular basis and then they are notified if they miss out their daily regular activity. The second application where this type of system can be used is CCTV Surveillance where humans cannot keep watch on more than 10 cameras at a time. If this system is inserted one can detect any anomaly easily and from more number of cameras at a time and can help in minimizing error.
This system is composed of two parts: hardware part and software part. The hardware part consists of a camera, while the software part consists of action-detection and action-recognition algorithms software. Person’s actions are taken as a series of snapshots  by the camera and sent to the software to be analyzed and compared with an existing database of human actions.

1.2.	Objective of Project

•	The goal of this project ‘Action Recognition’ is to develop action recognition/detection system  for helping dumb people to convey their actions into text/speech.
•	Deep learning is a field inspired by the structure and function of the brain(neural networks).
•	Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) allow us to extract a wide range of features from images. 
•	I will be using CNN and several other deep learning methods combined with machine learning to improve the accuracy. 
•	The practical applications for it are many, ranging from advanced home living, to CCTV surveillance, health care monitoring applications, tele-immersion applications.
•	In this system, I am storing the images or videos of the human actions in our database along with its details.

1.3.	Problem Specification

•	The footage of CCTV can be used to identify actions on scene.
•	The image captured from the CCTV will be preprocessed which will remove the unwanted elements such as noise from the image.
•	After that, the system will then classify the actions based on its landmarks.
•	Then, the system will run a search through the database to find its perfect match and display the output.                     .
